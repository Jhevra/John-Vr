I am learning python in videos of a basic class, and put here my exercises, which I practice every day.

There are some exercises that I was unable to complete, perhaps due to lack of competence or just inexperience.

I still don't know how to use all the tools and options on github, so I'm sorry, for anything.

These files are my daily practices

  ## Special thanks

Special thanks to **Gustavo Guanabara** and his Python videos that have already taught me a lot.

And to everyone from **DIO**(Digital Innovation One)
