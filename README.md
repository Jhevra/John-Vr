<p>I am learning python in videos of a basic class, and put here my exercises, which I practice every day.<p/>

<p>There are some exercises that I was unable to complete, perhaps due to lack of competence or just inexperience.<p/>

<p>I still don't know how to use all the tools and options on github, so I'm sorry, for anything.<p/>

<p>These files are my daily practices<p/>

<h2>Special thanks<h2/>

<p>Special thanks to **Gustavo Guanabara** and his Python videos that have already taught me a lot.<p/>

<p>And to everyone from **DIO**(Digital Innovation One)<p/>
