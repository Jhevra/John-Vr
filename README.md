# -Daily-Python-practices
I am learning python in videos of a basic ''course'', and put here my exercises, which I practice every day.

There are some exercises that I was unable to complete, perhaps due to lack of competence or just inexperience.

I still don't know how to use all the tools and options on github, so I'm sorry, for anything.


These files are my daily practices
